# On-device scripts

A ChargeXcel unit can run one small script of your own, written in
[Berry](https://berry-lang.github.io/) (a small language used by Tasmota
that reads a lot like Python). The script runs **on the unit itself**, so it
needs no other computer. On a timer, it reads ChargeXcel's headroom and makes
HTTPS calls to a cloud API, for example your charging station vendor's
or your car maker's, to tell that equipment what to draw.

The one-sentence version, which nothing below changes: **the script reads
ChargeXcel's headroom and talks to a cloud API. It sends nothing back that
ChargeXcel acts on.** What it hands back is only shown on the `/dlm` page.

The examples in [`../scripts/`](../scripts/) are real. `epiccharging.be` and
`smartcar.be` have both run against those vendors' real APIs. Before you
paste a script into a unit, test it on your own computer with
[`../runner/`](../runner/).

## Turning it on

On the unit's web portal, open **`/dlm`** (Load Management Plugins):

1. **Connector** card: choose *On-device script* and press **Switch**. Only
   one optional connector runs at a time (none, on-device script, or the
   built-in Tesla connector), because each one's memory is set aside once
   when the unit starts. Switching restarts ChargeXcel for about 10 seconds.
   The relay opens and re-closes on its normal schedule.
2. **On-device script**: paste the script and press **Install and run**.
   It compiles on the unit and ticks straight away. The status table shows
   the result, the last error (with a line number), and the memory peak.
3. **Script secrets**: enter any API keys or account names the script needs.
   The script reads them with `dlm.secret("name")`. Values are never shown
   again. Never put a secret in the script text.

You can keep a few scripts on the unit under names with **Save as** and
switch between them from the *Saved scripts* list.

Off-board plugins (see [`http-api.md`](http-api.md)) keep working whichever
connector is selected.

## The shape of a script

```berry
interval = 60          # seconds between ticks (30..3600, default 60)
import json            # the modules that exist: json, string, math

def tick()
  var t = dlm.telemetry()
  # ... decide, call dlm.http(), ...
  dlm.report(true, "what I did")
end
```

- The whole file runs once when it is installed, and again after an error
  reload. That is where `interval`, the imports and any globals get set.
- `tick()` is then called every `interval` seconds. It must exist.
- Globals survive between ticks, so a script can cache a token or remember
  what it last told the car. They are lost when the script is reinstalled
  or when an error forces a reload.
- `interval` is read once, after the top-level code runs. Missing or not
  an integer means 60. It is clamped to 30..3600.

## What ChargeXcel gives the script

### `dlm.telemetry()` → map

A fresh snapshot each call, with the same figures `/api/dlm/v1/tick` gives an
off-board plugin. Berry integers here are 32-bit and reals are single
precision.

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `epoch` | int | Wall-clock seconds since 1970, or `0` until the unit has synced its clock. |
| `time_trusted` | bool | Whether `epoch` is real. Check it before any time-of-day logic. |
| `ct_valid` | bool | Whether the three current readings are real measurements. `false` means they are placeholders. A failed read's zeros look just like an idle house, so don't read them as amps. |
| `service_leg_a_amps`, `service_leg_b_amps` | real | The two service legs, in amps. They are deliberately not called L1/L2: an electrician may clamp either sensor onto either leg. |
| `evse_branch_amps` | real | What the charging-station branch is drawing now. |
| **`allowed_amps`** | real | **The number to plan against.** How much the charging-station branch may draw right now without pushing either service leg past its continuous limit. Never below 0. |
| `allowed_amps_valid` | bool | `false` means "no opinion", **never** "unlimited". Either the unit is not commissioned or its sensors aren't trusted right now. When `false`, `allowed_amps` is 0 and meaningless. |
| `relay_permitted` | bool | Whether ChargeXcel currently allows the charging circuit to be live. |
| `relay_closed` | bool | Whether the circuit actually is live. With `relay_permitted`, a script can say "charging stopped, and it wasn't me". |
| `safety_state` | string | ChargeXcel's own state, e.g. `RUNNING`, `SHED_OFF`, `TRIP_LATCHED`, `THERMAL_OFF`. Context only; `relay_permitted` is the one to branch on. |
| `service_rating_amps` | real | The service rating the electrician entered. |
| `evse_breaker_rating_amps` | real | The charging-station branch breaker. |
| `continuous_capacity_amps` | real | The most the charging-station branch may ever be asked for on this installation. Never plan above it. |
| `topology` | int | `1` = split phase 120/240 V, `2` = split phase 120/208 V. Use it to turn amps into watts: `volts = topology == 2 ? 208 : 240`. (The HTTP route sends this as a string; the script gets the integer.) |
| `solar_installed` | bool | With solar, the service sensors cannot tell export from import, so net-zero logic has to reason about the legs differently. |

Changing this map changes nothing outside the script.

### `dlm.secret(name)` → string or nil

A value from the *Script secrets* card: up to four secrets, names up to 15
characters, values up to 127. Returns `nil` if that name isn't set. Never
`dlm.log()` a secret.

### `dlm.http(method, url, headers, body)` → `[status, body]`

One HTTP or HTTPS request. The firmware makes the request for the script;
the script never gets a socket.

| Argument | |
|---|---|
| `method` | `"GET"`, `"POST"`, `"PATCH"`, `"PUT"` or `"DELETE"`. |
| `url` | Must start with `http://` or `https://`. Redirects are **not** followed. |
| `headers` | A map of `"Name": "value"` strings, or `nil`. Together they must fit in 1,024 bytes as `Name: value` lines. That is room for a real OAuth bearer token (~830 bytes) plus two or three more headers. |
| `body` | A string, or `nil`. It is sent as given, so set `Content-Type` yourself. |

| `status` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `100`..`599` | The HTTP status the server sent. |
| `-1` | Transport failure: the unit couldn't connect, it timed out (10 s), or TLS failed. A server whose certificate authority isn't in the unit's trust store also looks like this. |
| `-2` | TLS busy: the unit's one HTTPS session was held by its own firmware-update check for more than 15 s. Try again next tick. |
| `-3` | This tick has already made 16 requests. |
| `-4` | Bad arguments (see above). |

`body` is the response body, **cut at 4,096 bytes**. If a list endpoint can
return more than that, use its filter or paging options. It is `""` on any
negative status.

Every call is at least one second after the last one (the firmware waits),
a tick can make at most 16, and the unit has only one HTTPS session at a
time. Time spent waiting inside `dlm.http()` does not count against the
tick's instruction budget.

### `dlm.log(text)`

Writes up to 120 characters to the unit's log and to the *Last log* line on
`/dlm`. Berry's `print()` goes to the same place.

## What the script gives back

### `dlm.report(present, action)`

This is the **only** way back, and it is only displayed:

- `present` (bool): `true` if the script is actively doing something (shown
  as *active*), `false` if it has nothing to do right now (*idle*).
- `action` (string): up to **31 characters** saying what it did. Longer text
  is cut, and anything outside printable ASCII becomes `?`.

If `tick()` returns without reporting, the row shows *idle*. If `tick()`
raises an error, the row shows `error: …`. If a tick reports more than once,
the last report wins.

**Nothing reads `present` or `action` except the web pages.** The script
cannot raise or lower ChargeXcel's limits, open or close the relay, or
change its state. See [`safety-properties.md`](safety-properties.md).

## Limits

- **Modules.** Only `json`, `string` and `math`. `os`, `sys`, `debug`,
  `introspect`, `gc`, `time`, `file` and the rest are compiled out, so
  `import os` is an error. There is no file system, no socket and no
  clock; use `epoch` for the time.
- **Instruction budget.** A tick gets about 2.1 million Berry instructions.
  Past that it is stopped with `timeout_error`. Waiting on `dlm.http()`
  doesn't count.
- **Memory.** Everything the script allocates (strings, maps, its compiled
  code) comes from a fixed 20 KB arena, never the unit's own memory. When
  the arena runs out, the tick fails with "out of memory". A 4 KB response
  body plus its `json.load()` result is the usual peak. `/dlm` shows the
  peak so you can see your margin.
- **Size.** Up to 8,192 bytes of source, and up to 4,096 bytes per string.
- **Errors.** Any error in a tick (timeout, out of memory, an exception, a
  bad `json.load()`) fails that tick. The unit then throws the VM away and
  rebuilds the script from source after about five minutes.
- **One script per unit.** It runs on its own low-priority task, so a slow
  request stalls only the script, never ChargeXcel.

## Writing a good one

**Only tell the equipment when the answer changes.** Opening an HTTPS session
is the most expensive thing a script does, both for the unit and for the
vendor's API. `smartcar.be` shows the pattern. Every tick it reads the
headroom and reports, but it sends a start or stop only when the decision
changes, plus once every 15 minutes in case a command was lost.
Commanding on every tick means 60 TLS handshakes an hour for a state that
changes a few times a day.

**Expect on/off, not a current knob.** Most cloud EV APIs give third-party
apps start, stop and a state-of-charge limit, not a live amperage setting.
So the usual policy is binary: charge while `relay_permitted` and
`allowed_amps` is at least the car's minimum (6 A), otherwise stop.
`epiccharging.be` is the exception: that vendor accepts a continuous kW
setpoint, so the script splits the headroom across the ports that are
charging and clamps each port to its own maximum.

**Check `allowed_amps_valid` first** and report `false` when there's no
figure. A script that treats "no figure" as "no limit" is wrong.

**Keep `action` short and true.** It is all the owner sees about your
script without opening the log.

## The examples

| Script | Vendor | Policy | Secrets |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`minimal.be`](../scripts/minimal.be) | a made-up API | kW limit every tick; the smallest complete script | `api_key` |
| [`epiccharging.be`](../scripts/epiccharging.be) | epiccharging.com | split the headroom in kW across charging ports | `tenant`, `api_key` |
| [`smartcar.be`](../scripts/smartcar.be) | smartcar.com | start/stop on 6 A, send only on change | `client_id`, `client_secret`, `vehicle_id`, `user_id` |

Tesla isn't a script. It is a built-in connector in the firmware.
