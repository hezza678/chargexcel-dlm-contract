// The Dynamic Load Management (DLM) plugin contract: what ChargeXcel tells an
// outside program about the service, and the two things that program may say
// back.
//
// ChargeXcel is a load manager, not an EVSE. It measures the service, works
// out how much the EV branch may draw, and opens its relay if the service is
// overdrawn. It has no way to ask a car to draw LESS -- every way of asking
// is vendor-specific (OCPP, Tesla's Fleet API, Modbus, ...) -- so it does not
// try. It publishes its headroom; a plugin, running on some other computer,
// reads that number and speaks the vendor protocol to the actual charging
// equipment itself. Nothing the plugin sends back is an input to any decision
// here: the plugin reports whether it is active and, in a few words, what it
// is doing, and that is shown on /dlm and the dashboard. That is all.
//
// Why that is the safe shape and not a weaker one: with nothing to accept,
// there is nothing to clamp, nothing to expire, and no path -- not even a
// clamped one -- from a plugin to the current limit or the relay. A plugin
// that crashes, lies, floods, or goes quiet changes what the /dlm page says
// and nothing else. The load-shedding code never reads anything from this
// file, and a source check in the build keeps it that way.
//
// This header is platform-free on purpose, so it compiles and runs on a
// desktop as well as on the unit. That is why the commissioning figures
// arrive as plain scalars.

// What ChargeXcel publishes to a plugin each tick. Serialized to JSON for the
// HTTP route; treat it as a wire schema and add fields on the end.
